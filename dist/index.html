      Well, you only need the light when it's burning low
      Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
      Only know you love her when you let her go
      Only know you've been high when you're feeling low
      Only hate the road when you're missing home
      Only know you love her when you let her go
      And you let her go
    </li>
    <li>
      Staring at the bottom of your glass
      Hoping one day you'll make a dream last
      But dreams come slow, and they go so fast
    </li>
    <li>
      You see her when you close your eyes
      Maybe one day, you'll understand why
      Everything you touch surely dies
    </li>
    <li>
      Staring at the ceiling in the dark
      Same old empty feeling in your heart
      'Cause love comes slow, and it goes so fast
    </li>
    <li>
      Well, you see her when you fall asleep
      But never to touch and never to keep
      'Cause you loved her too much, and you dived too deep
    </li>
    <li>
      'Cause you only need the light when it's burning low
      Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
      Only know you love her when you let her go
      Only know you've been high when you're feeling low
      Only hate the road when you're missing home
      Only know you love her when you let her go
    </li>

      Here's to the ones that we got
      Cheers to the wish you were here, but you're not
      'Cause the drinks bring back all the memories
      Of everything we've been through
      Toast to the ones here today
      Toast to the ones that we lost on the way
      'Cause the drinks bring back all the memories
      And the memories bring back, memories bring back you
    </li>

      There's a time that I remember, when I did not know no pain
      When I believed in forever, and everything would stay the same
      Now my heart feel like December when somebody say your name
      'Cause I can't reach out to call you, but I know I will one day, yeah
    </li>
